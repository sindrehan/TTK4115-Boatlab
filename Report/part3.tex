\subsection{Problem a}

\todo{SPÃ˜R STUDASS HVORDAN man skal ta hensyn til $\psi$ i deloppgave b), c), og d). SVAR: Det er allerede tatt hensyn til ettersom psi holder seg innen 35 grader. Skriv om dette i svarene}

\todo{Can we get the figures closer to the text?}

The PD transfer function is of the form
\begin{align*}
    H_{pd}(s) &= K_{pd}(1+T_d s)/(1+T_f s) \\
              &= K_{pd}(1+T s)/(1+\alpha T s)
\end{align*}

Where $T_d = T$ in order to cancel the systems pole factor $(Ts + 1)$, and $T_f = \alpha T_d = \alpha T$. We set $K_{pd} = 0.8, \alpha = 0.1$. \Cref{fig:3a-bode_and_phasemargin} contains the bode plot of the system $H(s) = H_{ship}(s)H_{pd}(s)$, with the phase margin Pm at 48.3 degrees, and crossover angular frequency at 0.104 rad/s.

Phase margin was found through the $margin(sys)$ MATLAB function, by using trial and error in placing $K_{pd}$ and $\alpha$. The $margin$ function calculates the phase margin by solving for the difference between the system phase and -180 degrees at the angular frequency where the systems amplitude is 1. \todo{Skriv litt bedre om margin funksjonen}

\subsection{Problem b}
As shown in \cref{fig:3b-psi_and_rudder}, the autopilot functions well with only measurement noise.  It reaches the setpoint with acceptable inputs and minimal oscillations.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Problem c}
With measurement noise and current disturbances, the autopilot functions as shown in \cref{fig:3b-psi_and_rudder_w_current}. While the angle approaches the setpoint with acceptable rudder inputs, there is an unacceptable steady state error. This is expected since the current creates a bias in the rudder and there is no integral term in the controller to eliminate steady state errors.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Problem d}
With measurement noise, current and wave disturbances the autopilot functions as shown in \cref{fig:3b-psi_and_rudder_w_waves}. The controller reacts to the waves high frequency by creating unacceptable high frequency noise on the input. This would strain the motors and/or rudder of the ship. Furthermore, the heading does not settle on the setpoint, but rather oscillates around it in response to the waves. Since the disturbances are easily modeled, a filter could be used to reduce the noise in the controller. Therefore, the controller could better hold the ship's heading.
