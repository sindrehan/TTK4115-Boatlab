\section{Identification of wave spectrum model}
\subsection{Problem a}
The MATLAB function \texttt{pwelch} calculates an estimate of the power spectral density PSD through
dividing the signal $\psi_w$ into K overlapping blocks multiplied by a windowing function, and finding an
estimate for the periodogram of each one.

\subsection{Problem b}

\subsection{Problem c}

$\omega_0 = 0.0029$, found through taking the max of pxx$/2\pi$. This is the resonant frequency and the
point where ???? $\psi_\omega$ correlates the most with itself
