\section{Identification of wave spectrum model}
\subsection{Problem a}
The MATLAB function \texttt{pwelch} calculates an estimate of the power spectral density PSD through
dividing the signal $\psi_w$ into K overlapping blocks multiplied by a windowing function, and finding an
estimate for the periodogram of each one.

\subsection{Problem b}
Se beskrivelsen i 

\subsection{Problem c}

$\omega_0 = 0.7823$, found through finding where the max of pxx$/2\pi$ is in the x-axis. This is the resonant frequency and the point where ???? $\psi_\omega$ correlates the most with itself.

\subsection{Problem d}
$\sigma^2 = 0.0015$
