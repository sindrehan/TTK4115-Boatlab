\section{Identification of wave spectrum model}
\subsection{}
The MATLAB function \texttt{pwelch} calculates an estimate of the power spectral density PSD through dividing the signal $\psi_w$ into K overlapping blocks multiplied by a windowing function, and finding an estimate for the periodogram of each one.
